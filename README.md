# What is OTItemEditor?

OTItemEditor is a program used to edit the OTB data files used by OpenTibia
servers and tools to map the item IDs used by the client to a consistent set of
IDs used by the server and tools. This is necessary since CIPSoft changes the
client-side IDs every major version released and remapping of them is required.

This tool can read the Tibia.dat / Tibia.spr files distrbuted with the client
and either match them up with the server-side IDs via image recognition and also
add new items to the data files.
