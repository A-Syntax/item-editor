What is this?
	This is an editor to edit otb files which holds important information 
about items.


How does it work?
	Copy the files tibia.dat and tibia.spr from your Tibia client directory 
to where you extracted OTItemEditor. Then load your items.otb or download latest from
http://opentibia.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/opentibia/otserv/trunk/data/items/items.otb?view=log.
You may need to download the latest graphics.dat from
http://opentibia.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/opentibia/otitemeditor/trunk/graphics.dat?view=log
to load newer version graphics.

**IMPORTANT 1**
Many of item properties have been moved to items.xml. So this editor is not needed
if you want to change an item name.

**IMPORTANT 2**
Otb files generated by this editor version are not compatible with previous versions.
